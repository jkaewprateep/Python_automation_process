Python and automation process for a small single-batch task

## 🧸💬 Defined the responsibility side and awareness of the possible one-side advantage from the networks.

🐑💬 ➰ Responsibility area is where they know of functions responsive, settings, and communication in any channels to create an effective response at the time of the event incident occurring or scheduled actions. Notifications and alerts is one of the shortcuts to access information quickly or information can be forwarded from plam or accessible devices for effective communications. </br>
🦭💬 Notification levels and communications messages can vary by the system's current load and settings to create a proper response to the meaning of time and design of the system, actions to respond is not notifications and it can carry of information for authentication as labels or permission request reference but it is not action response permissions. </br>

### 🧸💬 In the automation process of a single batch task, multiple events are created on the client's side to handle by the server side, the message communication to effective response, communication bandwidths and communications are defined, and attackers need to repeat the learning message to their estimate result for benefits in someway that the networks administrator does not know and the method is developed by time and technology, communication and new information deprecated into the Internet or public speakers. 

🐐💬 The attacker tries to create information that is copied from a duplicated of the communication message and response and tries to attach this information to one of the servers to find benefits of the system verification online or see the system behavior for system failures recovery abilities estimation before attacks. The attackers do not need to attach or update any information but only create delays in the process, create mistakes in communication, create requests for verification, or call for attentions. </br>
