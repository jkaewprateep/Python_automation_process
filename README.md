# Python and automation process for a small single-batch task
Python and automation process for a small single-batch task

## 🧸💬 Defined the responsibility side and awareness of the possible one-side advantage from the networks.

🐑💬 ➰ Responsibility area is where they know of functions responsive, settings, and communication in any channels to create an effective response at the time of the event incident occurring or scheduled actions. Notifications and alerts is one of the shortcuts to access information quickly or information can be forwarded from plam or accessible devices for effective communications. </br>
🦭💬 Notification levels and communications messages can vary by the system's current load and settings to create a proper response to the meaning of time and design of the system, actions to respond is not notifications and it can carry of information for authentication as labels or permission request reference but it is not action response permissions. </br>

### 🧸💬 In the automation process of a single batch task, multiple events are created on the client's side to handle by the server side, the message communication to effective response, communication bandwidths and communications are defined, and attackers need to repeat the learning message to their estimate result for benefits in someway that the networks administrator does not know and the method is developed by time and technology, communication and new information deprecated into the Internet or public speakers. 

🐐💬 The attacker tries to create information that is copied from a duplicate of the communication message and response and tries to attach this information to one of the servers to find benefits of the system verification online or see the system behavior for system failures recovery abilities estimation before attacks. The attackers do not need to attach or update any information but only create delays in the process, create mistakes in communication, create requests for verification, or call for attentions. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Consider the delays process of the communication message servers may affect the online use leave of the purchasing actions because of delays in time response of the process, have incorrect information displayed on the website or sources of information or blank output on promotions sales business teams are planned with notification or without notifications. The manual process is available but to continue the process from one medium to another medium is found in royalty customers only. </br>
🦤💬 In the design of a network firewall controls the network input/output or bandwidth with the ability to filter and basically analyze the network packets for source or website original networks sources where DNS and load balancing are placed in the organization's internal zone, the communication message may process for communication, partial because of they are inside networks or not process. One or multiple of the messages under a hundred messages are handled per minute and cannot create a delay in the process as application exceptions, network acceptions, the stamina of the server, and protection of the network firewall. One way is the attacker tries to expand the effect from lower hundreds of messages by the server they are required in the communication, DNS directory name services, and permission acquiring services, and of course internal solution communication needs to be verified by vendors responsible for the system design. </br>
* 🐣💬 In some systems zero address communication or zero network address header or incorrect format request and response messages have the same effects because the request messages contain query strings to process and network routers or system monitoring cannot determine. </br>

* 🐑💬 ➰ Possibility this issues is foudn on PII and communication devices.
1.	As transmitter the event transfer 0 address happen by one of these causes. </br>
    a.	There is no correct encryption result return. <img width="3%" src="https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Python_automation_process/blob/main/idx_03.png"></br>
    b.	There is no address and pre-requisites encryption variables example status, timestamp, from address and value. <img width="3%" src="https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Python_automation_process/blob/main/idx_02.png"></br>
    c.	Some process cause to release the transmission before sufficient process time. </br>
2.	As receiver the event receive transfer 0 address happen by one of these causes. </br>
    a.	By the transmitter message and incorrect implementation of exception error codes. </br>
    b.	By unbalance circuits or un-recognized patterns. </br>
    c.	***By incorrect matrix value registered, firmware and etc.*** <img width="3%" src="https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Python_automation_process/blob/main/idx_01.png"></br>

### Communication Protocols
🐑💬 ➰ There are multiple blocks of package in communication message continue with different messages, weights and values assigned to the message store on local and communication.  </br>

Ethereum MainNet ref [0] </br>
</br>
👧💬 🎈 In secured message encryption with different weights generated from each node represents from client or terminal and values. Node perform encryption and target node in communication can decrypt of the communication messages by their generated values and weights. In distribution values of weights and challenge can create multiple of secrete keys with target precision values and matrix arrays sizes they can combined of weight to decrypt and verification of its results call validation message. </br>

### Networks weights communication

🦭💬 In network weights communication it requires only summing weight to verify but it requires keys and authorization for decrypted messages and the original message and it requires weights, priority, and keys to update the message to the original message, the concept is everyone can request for communication and the selector selected node to communicate, the communication nodes are generated message with their weight and priority order in the central node, selector or selection. These cumulative messages will be filtered and organized from multiple of selected nodes performing tasks and verified with the trial message by summing up or additional methods before synchronizing and permitted to write to original message. </br>

### Node message transferring 
🐑💬 ➰ Node message communication is serialized of continue message with different weights, keys, and values and they can validate the transmitting node message by negotiate method.

</p>
Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications ref [3] </br>
</br>
🐑💬 ➰ There are communication node verification and local node verification before communication message with security requirements as simple secured messages communications. The negotiation process is similar to the state message communication with multiple steps of request and states feedback responses. In self-verification the transmission node can verify of the message before transmit or verify software settings and versions for communication program standards. </br>

</p>
Peer-to-Peer networking and Applications ref [3] </br>
</br>
🐑💬 ➰ During the negotiation time communication from source node reach to the target node as final step transmission from the source node will be validate at the target node and select of available block for communication message. The all answer from all nodes is not required to be the same but the available block will be message to communicate when each node continue work on their processing weight and value and responses once there is message event trigger the same as multiple agents AI response to environment simulation. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ In distribution process system the central node or response node not only record of transaction but also perform tasks or actions results from communication and feedback to each node when they are working on their task same as rewards of results if consider as communication in distribution process and no-feedback communication record sample information record. </br>

### Python codes task example

```
def task(event: Event, id: int) -> None:
    print(f'Thread {id} started. Wait for the signal....')
    event.wait()
    print(f'Receive signal. The thread {id} was completed.')
```

## Objectives

| Objective | Response | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Notification when transfer event happens with in 2 minutes | Each node represents self-validation and organize validation and notify for the transfer event | Each node notify messages event will create dramatic of message bandwidths generate but limited by transfer rates |
| Resilient – No downtime | In registered intervals from negotiation message all node will re-negotiate or create new negotiate communication required or hits target rates | The last call of communication is validated of the values in transactions in the central node or the provider |
| Cost-effective | Implementing codes are not complex and message event create after task’s state changed | In IoT communication task distribution or individual target device is ability to response of performance |
| Can easily be modified to add more token transfer monitorings (e.g. to other addresses, or monitor other token addresses) | Secured communication algorithm has many levels of negotiation for secured message with high contrast secrete key algorithm and symmetric communication secured message algorithms | Depends on communication rates for fast response symmetric keys can secured message communication fast with timestamps and required fields with natural time expired |
| Symmetric key algorithm support by default of each node communication for negotiation messages and fast communication | For default protection level secured symmetric key are installed for each node differently and they can use for negotiation message or fast communication | Not only power calculation can be decrypted of the transferring message because expiry message time and hardware or application ID. |
| Asymmetric key algorithm support by default and promote of new key from current key or total new key when required | For message negotiation a new key communication selected from existing key or combined key from the negotiation process that is because of algorithm allowed concatenate keys | Not only power calculation can be decrypted of the transferring message because expiry message time and hardware or application ID. |
| Notification method with target notification database support of transaction and delays communication response | Allowed for caches time communication messages and multi-nodes challenge with local database for filtered transactions for validation. | At the final steps of communication need report, database records and monitoring for notification because will notify by the acceptable rates |
| Communication results can trace of errors and distribution rates | Summary statistics for distribution communications and errors will be records and stored at transaction database at the final state | At the final steps after the communication concluded summarized and errors are record same as TCP/IP communication in local networks area |
| Database communication can support of headless encryption communication for statistics records communication with less of secured algorithm applied | Multiple states message communication with number and target fields from the requester can transmitted with symmetric or none encryption for speed and safe of calculation power | There are many of database support headless secured communication and implementation with the same format possible in database communication scenario |
| Neighborhood devices can have different of communication pattern | Multiple states message communication response by the request format from the verified requester | There are services and publisher need to be notified with preferred format and requirements before receive response that is another secure level of the solution |
| Support of node priority by performance and proficiency Backup and restore support by remote script execution | There are multiple of weight and value can create formula for challenge but default work distribution algorithm is message rates Support by default | Workload distribution algorithms or individual initiate events from each node All node has the same code |
