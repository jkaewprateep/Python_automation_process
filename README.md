Python and automation process for a small single-batch task

## 🧸💬 Defined the responsibility side and awareness of the possible one-side advantage from the networks.

🐑💬 ➰ Responsibility area is where they know of functions responsive, settings, and communication in any channels to create an effective response at the time of the event incident occurring or scheduled actions. Notifications and alerts is one of the shortcuts to access information quickly or information can be forwarded from plam or accessible devices for effective communications. </br>
🦭💬 Notification levels and communications messages can vary by the system's current load and settings to create a proper response to the meaning of time and design of the system, actions to respond is not notifications and it can carry of information for authentication as labels or permission request reference but it is not action response permissions. </br>

### 🧸💬 In the automation process of a single batch task, multiple events are created on the client's side to handle by the server side, the message communication to effective response, communication bandwidths and communications are defined, and attackers need to repeat the learning message to their estimate result for benefits in someway that the networks administrator does not know and the method is developed by time and technology, communication and new information deprecated into the Internet or public speakers. 

🐐💬 The attacker tries to create information that is copied from a duplicate of the communication message and response and tries to attach this information to one of the servers to find benefits of the system verification online or see the system behavior for system failures recovery abilities estimation before attacks. The attackers do not need to attach or update any information but only create delays in the process, create mistakes in communication, create requests for verification, or call for attentions. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Consider the delays process of the communication message servers may affect the online use leave of the purchasing actions because of delays in time response of the process, have incorrect information displayed on the website or sources of information or blank output on promotions sales business teams are planned with notification or without notifications. The manual process is available but to continue the process from one medium to another medium is found in royalty customers only. </br>
🦤💬 In the design of a network firewall controls the network input/output or bandwidth with the ability to filter and basically analyze the network packets for source or website original networks sources where DNS and load balancing are placed in the organization's internal zone, the communication message may process for communication, partial because of they are inside networks or not process. One or multiple of the messages under a hundred messages are handled per minute and cannot create a delay in the process as application exceptions, network acceptions, the stamina of the server, and protection of the network firewall. One way is the attacker tries to expand the effect from lower hundreds of messages by the server they are required in the communication, DNS directory name services, and permission acquiring services, and of course internal solution communication needs to be verified by vendors responsible for the system design. </br>
* 🐣💬 In some systems zero address communication or zero network address header or incorrect format request and response messages have the same effects because the request messages contain query strings to process and network routers or system monitoring cannot determine. </br>

* 🐑💬 ➰ Possibility this issues is foudn on PII and communication devices.
1.	As transmitter the event transfer 0 address happen by one of these causes. </br>
    a.	There is no correct encryption result return. <img width="3%" src="https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Python_automation_process/blob/main/idx_03.png"></br>
    b.	There is no address and pre-requisites encryption variables example status, timestamp, from address and value. <img width="3%" src="https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Python_automation_process/blob/main/idx_02.png"></br>
    c.	Some process cause to release the transmission before sufficient process time. </br>
2.	As receiver the event receive transfer 0 address happen by one of these causes. </br>
    a.	By the transmitter message and incorrect implementation of exception error codes. </br>
    b.	By unbalance circuits or un-recognized patterns. </br>
    c.	***By incorrect matrix value registered, firmware and etc.*** <img width="3%" src="https://github.com/jkaewprateep/Python_automation_process/blob/main/idx_01.png"></br>

### Communication Protocols
🐑💬 ➰ There are multiple blocks of package in communication message continue with different messages, weights and values assigned to the message store on local and communication.  </br>

</br>
👧💬 🎈 In secured message encryption with different weights generated from each node represents from client or terminal and values. Node perform encryption and target node in communication can decrypt of the communication messages by their generated values and weights. In distribution values of weights and challenge can create multiple of secrete keys with target precision values and matrix arrays sizes they can combined of weight to decrypt and verification of its results call validation message. </br>

### Networks weights communication

🦭💬 In network weights communication it requires only summing weight to verify but it requires keys and authorization for decrypted messages and the original message and it requires weights, priority, and keys to update the message to the original message, the concept is everyone can request for communication and the selector selected node to communicate, the communication nodes are generated message with their weight and priority order in the central node, selector or selection. These cumulative messages will be filtered and organized from multiple of selected nodes performing tasks and verified with the trial message by summing up or additional methods before synchronizing and permitted to write to original message. </br>

### Node message transferring 
🐑💬 ➰ Node message communication is serialized of continue message with different weights, keys, and values and they can validate the transmitting node message by negotiate method.
